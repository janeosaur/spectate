# spectate
Deployed on: https://spectator.herokuapp.com/

App for all CSGO fans to browse and search CSGO events by a variety of filters, and to explore attending teams and rosters.

CSGO (and eSports in general) has become a huge spectator sport. At least every month there is a high profile, high pay-out tournament filling stadiums in various countries around the world. In the past the only way to get information for these events was to go directly to the respective tournament organizer's website. 

Spectate allows users to search these events by parameters and filters that haven't been available before. If a user wants to go to the next event taking place in Finland, or wants to go to an event that sells alcohol or team merchandise - they can do it all on Spetate!
